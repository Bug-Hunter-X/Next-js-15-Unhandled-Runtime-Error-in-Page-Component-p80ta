# Next.js 15 Unhandled Runtime Error in Page Component

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js 15 applications: unhandled runtime errors within page components.  Improper error handling can lead to application crashes and unexpected behavior. 

The `pages/about.js` file contains a simple example where a variable is used before it's defined, causing a runtime error. 

The solution demonstrates how to implement proper error handling using try-catch blocks or other suitable techniques to prevent these errors.
